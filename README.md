# Binance-Pump-and-Dump-Bot

This bot will use a Discord bot to get a crypto currency name from Discord (signaled by a $) and place it into a txt file. The Python bot, which is run in parallel with the Javascript one, will take the crypto currency name output from the Javascript bot and use that as input, buying currency at the price and quantity specified by the user, and placing sell orders at either a minimum or maximum price for the crypto.

Inside main.py, you can change many variables to have the bot behave as you wish. You also need to input your Binance.com public and private keys, along with your Discord user token.
