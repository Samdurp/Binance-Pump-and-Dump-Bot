# Binance-Pump-and-Dump-Bot

This bot will use a Discord s3lfb0t (it's against Discord ToS so excuse the spelling) to get a crypto currency name from Discord (signaled by a $) and place it into a txt file. The Python bot, which is run in parallel with the Javascript one, will take the crypto currency name output from the Javascript bot and use that as input, buying currency at the price and quantity specified by the user, and placing sell orders at either a minimum or maximum price for the crypto.
